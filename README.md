# Manifest API

A pratice project inspired by Alin Panaitiu's post on [install any website as PWA](https://notes.alinpanaitiu.com/Install-any-website-as-PWA-on-iOS).

By "injecting" a manifest.json generated by this api in the html, with the help of browser extensions (e.g. [Modificator](https://apps.apple.com/ro/app/modificator-mods-for-websites/id1635358022)), we can trick the browser of thinking that the site is PWA-compatiable.

## ENV

- `KEYS`: An comma-separated array of keys accepted by the api. E.g. `A-SUPER-SECURE-KEY,ANOTHER-KEY`

## Routes

- `/v1/webmanif`: Generate the manifest.json file.
  - Params:
    - `name`: Name of the app displayed on the home screen
    - `color?`: Theme color. Should be hex-encoded value (e.g. #f23456)
    - `bg-color?`: Backgrouond color, if empty, use the theme color. Should be hex-encoded value (e.g. #f23456)
    - `icons?`: Urls for custom icons if the website didn't provide their own. It could be multiple params (e.g. `https://endpoint?icons=url1&icons=url2`)
